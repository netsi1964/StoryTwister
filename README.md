> This is documentation and container of generated stories using my GPT "[GPT Story Twister](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mBiNy6U9S-story-twister)". It was created partly to document my work building a GPT using OpenAI GPTs, and also so that you can perhaps use it in your own projects. You are welcome to create ideas or findings through an Github Issue. Hope you enjoy it!

## Generated stories

You can find a list of the generated stories in the [GPT Story Twister](https://netsi1964.github.io/StoryTwister/)

## Using Gatsby to publish stories to Netlify

I will use this Gatsby builder: [gatsby-starter-minimal-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog/)

## How to use

TODO

## Generate a story

You simply visit [GPT Story Twister](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mBiNy6U9S-story-twister) and create a story. When you have a story you want to puslish, simply prompt the GPT "Please publish my story". You will then get an URL to your published story! That process of publishing your story is done using the setup in this repository.
